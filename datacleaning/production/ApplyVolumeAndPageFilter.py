# ApplyVolumeAndPageFilter.py

# This production script rolls several functions that we've developed
# separately into a single script. Given a metadata file and a root
# folder where text files are stored, it will generate a matrix of
# features for each page in the text files. It will also generate
# a matrix of features for each volume, by averaging the features
# of pages in that volume.
#
# Then it applies two filters: first, a volume-level filter
# identifies volumes that are not in English or contain purely
# reference material. Those are marked for exclusion in the
# metadata file. 
# 
# Second, for each volume that remains, a page-level filter 
# identifies pages that are likely to be paratext. A new
# trimmed text file is created for each volume, with paratext
# pages removed. Running headers are also trimmed at this stage.

# The new files, with an extension of ".trim.txt", are saved in an
# output folder that is passed in as a command-line argument.
